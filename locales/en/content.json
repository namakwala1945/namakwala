From household cooking and baking to traditional pickling and modern packaged foods, salt ensures freshness and taste consistency.\n\nBeyond culinary uses, salt is also important in maintaining electrolyte balance in the human body, supporting hydration, and aiding proper muscle and nerve function. Daily consumption of iodized salt helps prevent iodine deficiency, promoting healthy growth and mental development.\n\nIn households, salt is commonly used for cleaning, oral care (like gargling with salt water), and even skincare remedies. Across industries, industrial salt supports agriculture, water treatment, and chemical production, making it indispensable in modern life.\n\nSalt in daily life is more than just a seasoning — it is a natural, versatile, and valuable mineral that connects taste, tradition, health, and industry in one simple crystal.",
